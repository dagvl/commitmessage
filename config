# commitmessage Version 1.0
# Copyright 2002 Stephen Haberman
#
# Configuration of commitmessage is simple. Merely modify this file and make
# sure any packages you refer to are in @INC or the CVSROOT.
#
# To setup a View for all modules, the format is:
#
#   DEFAULT.view-name = package-name
#
# To setup a View on a per-module basis only, the format is:
#
#   match-name = regex
#   match-name.view-name = package-name
#
# Where:
# - match-name is an arbitrary name for any commit with a basedir that
#   matches the regex pattern
# - view-name is an arbitrary name for a view instance, e.g. "email"
# - package-name is the name of the .pm file in CVSROOT/commitmessage
#   that will be executed, e.g. "ViewEmail"
#
# After that, you can define properties to be passed to the View via:
#
#   DEFAULT.view-name.property-name = property-value
#
# Or:
# 
#   match-name.view-name.property-name = property-value
#
# Each match-name inherits the DEFAULT view instances and the corresponding 
# properties. However, all of the global defaults can be overriden. 
# For example, a general ViewEmail might be setup like:
#
#   DEFAULT.email = ViewEmail
#   DEFAULT.email.from = cvs@host.com
#   ...
#
# But then each match-name can declare it's own properties for the global View,
# override existing global properties, and even override the package definition
# of the global view (the new definition would still receive the global and
# module properties). E.g.:
#
#   match-name.email = ViewSpecialEmail
#   match-name.email.from = different-from@host.com
#   match-name.email.to = new-to@host.com
#
# Also, a match can choose to completely ignore a global package definition
# by setting the package for the given view instance to nothing. E.g.:
#
#   match-name.email =
#
# Would have the match-name ignore the globally-defined email instance.


#
# Note: ViewEmail will not send unless the to property is set
#
