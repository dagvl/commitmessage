#
# commitmessage config file.
# Version 2.0
#
# Configuration of commitmessage is simple. Merely modify this file and make
# sure any packages you refer to are in @INC or the CVSROOT.
#
# To setup a View for all modules, the format is:
#
#   ALL.view-name = package-name
#
# To setup a View on a per-module basis only, the format is:
#
#   module-name.view-name = package-name
#
# Where:
# - module-name corresponds to a module in the CVS installation, e.g. "CVSROOT"
# - view-name is an arbitrary name for this module-to-view mapping, 
#   e.g. "email"
# - package-name is the name of the .pm file in CVSROOT that will be executed,
#   e.g. "ViewEmail"
#
# After that, you can define properties to be passed to the View via:
#
#   ALL.view-name.property-name = property-value
#
# Or:
# 
#   module-name.view-name.property-name = property-value
#
# Each modules inherits the ALL Views and the corresponding properties. However,
# all of the global defaults can be overriden .For example, a general ViewEmail 
# might be setup like:
#
#   ALL.email = ViewEmail
#   ALL.email.from = cvs\@host.com
#   ...
#
# But then each module can declare it's own properties for the global View,
# override existing global properties, and even override the package definition
# of the global view (the new definition would still receive the global and
# module properties). E.g.:
#
#   module-name.email = ViewSpecialEmail
#   module-name.email.from = different-from@host.com
#   module-name.email.to = new-to@host.com
#
# Also, a module can chook to completely ignore a global package definition
# by setting the package to nothing. E.g.:
#
#   module-name.email =
#
# Would have the module-name module ignore the globally-defined ViewEmail.


#
# Note: ViewEmail will not send unless the to property is set
#
