<h3>Mission</h3>

<p>
commitmessage provides a modular, easy-to-use approach to sending
CVS commit information to other systems.
</p>

<p>
Many scripts already exist to send out email diffs for commits, post
information into bug tracking systems, etc., but they all have tight coupling
between the logic of collecting information from CVS and the logic of sending
relevant information out to the other system.
</p>

<p>
commitmessage takes smarter approach: MVC.
</p>

<p>
Two scripts (<code>commitmessage_loginfo.pl</code> and
<code>commitmessage_commitinfo.pl</code>) act the Controllers
for the process and build a Model of the entire commit (not just
per-directory) that can then be passed on to various Views.
</p>

<p>
The Views are written as Perl packages to allow the Controllers to
interact with the Views as objects.
</p>

<p>
Setting up different Views only requires editing a very simple property
file: <code>commitmessage.config</code>. The Controllers never need editing.
</p>

<p>
Also, the <code>commitmessage.config</code> can contain various properties
on either a global or per-module basis to allow a single View package to be reused
by various modules.
</p>

<p>
The overall affect is cutting down on the extreme duplication between scripts that
used to occur just to change the target system or even simple properties such as 
Urls or mailing address for different modules.

The Perl scripts are originally based on the Apache CVS scripts at 
<a href="http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/CVSROOT/">http://cvs.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/CVSROOT/</a>.
While the Apache scripts had the cool per-commit instead of per-directory
functionality, the view logic of formatting together the email was spread
all over the file and directly mixed in with other logic.
